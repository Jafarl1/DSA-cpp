# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures written in C++. Each data structure is implemented from scratch, without relying on the C++ STL, in order to demonstrate a deep understanding of memory management, pointers, and algorithmic logic.

## Data Structures

- Stack
- Queue
- Singly and Doubly Linked Lists
- Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree
- Graphs (Adjacency List and Matrix)

## Algorithms

- Sorting: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort
- Searching: Linear, Binary, Exponential
- Graph Algorithms: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Topological Sort
- Dynamic Programming: 0/1 Knapsack, Fibonacci, LCS
- Greedy Algorithms: Coin Change, Fractional Knapsack
- Interview Patterns: Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Backtracking

## Project Structure

Each module is located in its own directory and includes:

- C++ source files
- Header files
- Sample usage in `main()` or test functions
- A dedicated README with usage instructions

## Build & Run

You can compile individual `.cpp` files using:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```
